## Breast Cancer Diagnosis System using YOLO and CNN Models

This repository contains the implementation of a **Breast Cancer Diagnosis System** using deep learning models, specifically **YOLOv8, YOLOv9 for tumor detection** and **VGG16, DenseNet121, InceptionV3 for classification**. The system is designed to assist medical professionals in detecting and classifying breast cancer using mammographic images.

## üìå Project Overview
Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality among women worldwide. Early detection is crucial for effective treatment and improved survival rates. This project applies **state-of-the-art deep learning models** to detect and classify breast tumors from medical images.

The system consists of two main components:
- **Object Detection (YOLOv8, YOLOv9):** Identifying tumor locations in mammograms.
- **Classification (CNN - VGG16, DenseNet121, InceptionV3):** Determining the nature of the detected tumors (Benign, Malignant, Normal).
